# Spatial Distance Histogram - CUDA Project

This repository contains a CUDA-accelerated solution for computing a **Spatial Distance Histogram (SDH)** on a set of 3D points. The project demonstrates the performance gains of GPU parallelization using CUDA compared to a baseline CPU implementation.

## üß† Problem Description

Given **N** 3D points and a distance bucket width **w**, the goal is to compute a histogram representing how many point-to-point distances fall into each bucket. The buckets are defined as ranges:

```
[0, w), [w, 2w), ..., [(l‚àí1)w, lw]
```

Where **l** is the number of buckets determined based on the maximum distance possible in the dataset.

The result is a histogram:

```
H = (h‚ÇÄ, h‚ÇÅ, ..., h‚Çó‚Çã‚ÇÅ)
```

Each **h·µ¢** contains the count of distances in the range [i¬∑w, (i+1)¬∑w).

## üöÄ CUDA Acceleration

The core of this project is a CUDA kernel that parallelizes the histogram generation by assigning each point to a thread. For each point, its distances to all other points are calculated, and the corresponding histogram bucket is incremented using atomic operations to avoid race conditions.

Key steps:

- Transfer the 3D point array from host to device.
- Launch CUDA kernel: each thread computes distances from one point to others.
- Use `atomicAdd()` to update the appropriate histogram bucket.
- Copy the histogram back to the host and compare it with the CPU-computed version.

## üìÅ File Structure

- `sdh_project.cu`: Main implementation file with both CPU and GPU versions of SDH computation.
- Sample usage:
  ```bash
  nvcc sdh_project.cu -o sdh_project
  ./sdh_project 10000 500
  ```
  - `10000` = number of points
  - `500` = bucket width

## üñ•Ô∏è Output

The output includes:

1. Histogram generated by CPU
2. Histogram generated by GPU
3. Difference between each corresponding bucket

This comparison helps validate the correctness of the GPU implementation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment

- CUDA 11.4 or higher
- NVIDIA GPU (e.g., GAIVI cluster node or local CUDA-capable machine)
- C++ / CUDA Compiler (`nvcc`)
