# GPU Computing Projects â€“ COP4520/6527

This repository contains three CUDA-based projects developed as part of the **COP4520/6527: Computing in Massively Parallel Systems** course. Each project focuses on solving computationally intensive problems using **GPU acceleration via CUDA**, with an emphasis on optimizing **parallel performance**, **memory access**, and **scalability**.

These implementations demonstrate effective techniques for transforming CPU-bound algorithms into high-performance GPU solutions.

## ðŸš€ Project Summaries

### 1. Spatial Distance Histogram (SDH)
**File:** `sdh_project.cu`  
Computes a histogram of distances between 3D particles, bucketed by fixed-width ranges. The CUDA kernel assigns each point to a thread, parallelizing the pairwise distance computation and significantly reducing runtime compared to the serial CPU version.

### 2. Optimized SDH with Shared Memory
**Files:** `sdh_accelerated.cu`, `Report.pdf`  
An enhanced version of the SDH algorithm that uses **shared memory** for local histogram accumulation. Reduces global memory contention and improves performance through **output privatization**, **coalesced memory access**, and **fine-tuned CUDA block sizing**.

### 3. Bloom Filter with SipHash on GPU
**Files:** `bloom.cu`, `Report.pdf`  
Implements a high-performance Bloom filter that uses **SipHash-2-4** for hashing and leverages **CUDA** to parallelize both insertion and membership queries. Key optimizations include **register-based hashing**, **coalesced memory access**, and **early-exit logic** for queries. Speedups of up to **350Ã—** were observed over the CPU baseline.

## ðŸ’¡ Key CUDA Concepts Applied

- Thread-level parallelism with 1:1 data-to-thread mapping
- Shared memory vs. global memory trade-offs
- Atomic operations (`atomicAdd`, `atomicOr`)
- Memory coalescing and DRAM latency hiding
- SIPROUND-based hashing in registers
- CUDA timing using `cudaEventRecord`

## ðŸŽ“ Academic Context

These projects were developed for **COP4520/6527: Computing in Massively Parallel Systems** at the University of South Florida (USF). Each assignment emphasizes practical GPU programming skills and efficient use of the CUDA architecture.
